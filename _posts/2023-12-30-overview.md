## Accommodation

May is a busy time of year in the Cambridge MA area, which means accommodation may be competitive. We are in the process of negotiating a group rate at a local hotel convenient to the wedding and reception. Check this page or reach out for updates. For those who are interested, a listing of hotels close to MIT [is available here](https://commencement.mit.edu/guests/visiting-cambridge/accommodations).

For those looking to stay outside of the Kendall Square/MIT area, we suggest staying near the [MBTA Red Line](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf) Porter Square, Davis Square, or Alewife stations for easy access via public transportation.

If you plan to drive to Cambridge, please to make a plan for parking your car when you arrange your accommodations. Parking in this area is scarce and parking enforcement can be harsh.

## Transportation

For out of town guests, our wedding venue is approximately four miles from the Logan Airport. Public tranportation from Logan Aiport to Cambridge is free. The taxi/Uber/Lyft ride is typically $30-35. Taxis are often the better option compared to Uber/Lyft during times of high demand.

On the day of the wedding we suggest that guests arrive on foot, by [Boston Public Transit (MBTA)](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf), or by Taxi/Uber. The reception venue is located directly on top of the [Kendall Square MBTA stop](https://www.mbta.com/stops/place-knncl).

The chapel and the reception are separated by a pleasant 15 minute walk along the Charles river ([directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/MIT+Chapel,+48+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02139,+United+States/MIT+Museum,+Gambrill+Center,+314+Main+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02142,+United+States/@42.3611752,-71.11131,14z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37a0081ab0b7d:0xfd6b535be007b424!2m2!1d-71.0941349!2d42.3583155!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37754d18b40ef:0xcba82b413cc2736d!2m2!1d-71.0863641!2d42.362114!3e2?entry=ttu)). In the event of rain our guests can take a shorter indoor route through a series of hallways on the MIT campus.

Driving to the wedding and reception is not recommended. The MIT police will set aside ten parking spaces at the Chapel for the duration of the ceremony. There will be no free parking available for the reception, because [Memorial drive will be closed](https://www.cambridgema.gov/streetsandtransportation/memorialdrive). MIT does have some expensive ($18+/hour) [public parking options](https://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html).
