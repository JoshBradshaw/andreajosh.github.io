## Accommodation

May is a busy time of year in the Cambridge MA area, which means that accommodations are competitive. Booking early is important.

We have reserved a [block of rooms at the Marriot](https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1705508530715&key=GRP), which is directly across the street from the reception venue. Guests may reserve rooms at the Marriot at a discounted rate until **April 24**. Guests can our [the online reservation portal](https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1705508530715&key=GRP) or book by calling Marriot Central Reservations at 1-800-228-9290.

We are additionally negotiating a somewhat more distant, but more affordable block of rooms at a Hotel in Somerville. Check back later or reach out for updates.

A general listing of hotels close to MIT [is available here](https://commencement.mit.edu/guests/visiting-cambridge/accommodations).

For those looking to stay outside of the Kendall Square/MIT area, we suggest staying near the [MBTA Red Line](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf) [Porter Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Fj5gcrcY5QdFHnz6), [Davis Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qLPQCDX8tfgtqZtZ9), or [Alewife stations](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H2DGYJ8CWRxAiugPA) for easy access via public transportation.

Some of our extended family will be staying at a [campground at the edge of the city](https://spaciousskiescampgrounds.com/minute-man/) and riding in on the [commuter rail]( https://www.mbta.com/schedules/commuter-rail). This an inexpensive option for people with children, or who anyone who wants to combine our wedding with a roadtrip.

If you plan to drive to Cambridge, please make a plan for parking your car when you arrange your accommodations. Parking in this area is scarce and parking enforcement can be harsh.

## Transportation

For out of town guests, our wedding venue is approximately three miles from the Logan Airport. Public transportation from Logan Airport to Cambridge is free. The taxi/Uber/Lyft ride is typically $30-35. Taxis are often the better option compared to Uber/Lyft during times of high demand.

On the day of the wedding we suggest that guests arrive on foot, by [Boston Public Transit (MBTA)](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf), or by Taxi/Uber. The reception venue is located directly on top of the [Kendall Square MBTA stop](https://www.mbta.com/stops/place-knncl).

The chapel and the reception are separated by a pleasant fifteen minute walk along the Charles river ([directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/MIT+Chapel,+48+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02139,+United+States/MIT+Museum,+Gambrill+Center,+314+Main+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02142,+United+States/@42.3611752,-71.11131,14z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37a0081ab0b7d:0xfd6b535be007b424!2m2!1d-71.0941349!2d42.3583155!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37754d18b40ef:0xcba82b413cc2736d!2m2!1d-71.0863641!2d42.362114!3e2?entry=ttu)). In the event of rain our guests can take a shorter indoor route through a series of hallways on the MIT campus.

Driving to the wedding and reception is not recommended. The MIT police will set aside ten parking spaces at the Chapel for the duration of the ceremony. There will be no free parking available for the reception, because [Memorial drive will be closed](https://www.cambridgema.gov/streetsandtransportation/memorialdrive). MIT does have some expensive ($18+/hour) [public parking options](https://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html).
