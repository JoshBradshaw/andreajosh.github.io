## RSVP 

[Please RSVP here](https://forms.gle/yNtpVW9MCpyCcn6j9).

RSVPs will be due April 25. We will communicate more in the meantime.

## Accommodation

May is a busy time of year in the Cambridge MA area, which means that accommodations are competitive. Booking early is important. If you plan to drive to Cambridge, please make a plan for parking your car when you arrange your accommodations. Parking in this area is scarce and parking enforcement can be harsh.

### Hotel Room Blocks

We've arranged courtesy room blocks at two local hotels:

| Marriot Kendall Square | $399 | [Booking website](https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1705508530715&key=GRP) | Across the street | April 24 |
| Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill | $329 | [Booking website](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/wyndham/boston-massachusetts/wyndham-boston-beacon-hill/rooms-rates?brand_id=HR&checkInDate=5/24/2024&checkOutDate=5/26/2024&useWRPoints=false&children=0&groupCode=0524ANDJOS&adults=1&rooms=1&loc=ChIJGzE9DS1l44kRoOhiASS_fHg&sessionId=1706298730) | 1 mile away | April 24 |

Both hotel room blocks are listed under the event name "Andrea Lehn & Josh Bradshaw Wedding". We do not benefit or incur any expenses based on your booking choices. 

### Alternative Accomodation Options

A general listing of hotels close to MIT [is available here](https://commencement.mit.edu/guests/visiting-cambridge/accommodations).

For those looking to stay outside of the Kendall Square/MIT area, we suggest staying near the [MBTA Red Line](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf) [Porter Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Fj5gcrcY5QdFHnz6), [Davis Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qLPQCDX8tfgtqZtZ9), or [Alewife stations](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H2DGYJ8CWRxAiugPA) for easy access via public transportation.

Some of our extended family will be staying at a [campground at the edge of the city](https://spaciousskiescampgrounds.com/minute-man/) and riding in on the [commuter rail]( https://www.mbta.com/schedules/commuter-rail). This an inexpensive option for people with children, or who anyone who wants to combine our wedding with a roadtrip.

## Transportation

For out of town guests, our wedding venue is approximately three miles from the Logan Airport. Public transportation from Logan Airport to Cambridge is free. The taxi/Uber/Lyft ride is typically $30-35. Taxis are often the better option compared to Uber/Lyft during times of high demand.

On the day of the wedding we suggest that guests arrive on foot, by [Boston Public Transit (MBTA)](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf), or by Taxi/Uber. The reception venue is located directly on top of the [Kendall Square MBTA stop](https://www.mbta.com/stops/place-knncl).

The chapel and the reception are separated by a pleasant fifteen minute walk along the Charles river ([directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/MIT+Chapel,+48+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02139,+United+States/MIT+Museum,+Gambrill+Center,+314+Main+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02142,+United+States/@42.3611752,-71.11131,14z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37a0081ab0b7d:0xfd6b535be007b424!2m2!1d-71.0941349!2d42.3583155!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37754d18b40ef:0xcba82b413cc2736d!2m2!1d-71.0863641!2d42.362114!3e2?entry=ttu)). In the event of rain our guests can take a shorter indoor route through a series of hallways on the MIT campus.

Driving to the wedding and reception is not recommended. The MIT police will set aside ten parking spaces at the Chapel for the duration of the ceremony. There will be no free parking available for the reception, because [Memorial drive will be closed](https://www.cambridgema.gov/streetsandtransportation/memorialdrive). MIT does have some expensive ($18+/hour) [public parking options](https://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html).
