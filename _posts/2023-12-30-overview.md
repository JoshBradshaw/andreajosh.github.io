# Date, Time & Location

Our wedding will take place on May 25th 2024. The ceremony will start at 5pm and the reception will start at 6pm. 

Ceremony | MIT Chapel | [Website](https://studentlife.mit.edu/cac/event-services-spaces/event-spaces/mit-chapel) | [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xRdoz4kD7amgpMMJ8)
Reception | MIT Museum | [Website](https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/) | [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/asSMSx7WSqyuaUDC9)

# Details

The reception will be hosted amongst the museum exhibits on the second floor. There will be an open bar serving wines beers and non-alcoholic options. Dinner will consist of many small plates and hor'dourves. There will be tables and chairs interspersed amongst the exhibits, but no formal seating plan.

We will be walking two and a half blocks from the ceremony to the reception as a group. There is an indoor route available in the event of rain. Please reach out if anyone in your party has mobility issues, so that we can arrange a shuttle.

# RSVP 

[RSVP Form](https://forms.gle/yNtpVW9MCpyCcn6j9). Responses are due April 18. The RSVP form is secure, and your personal information will only be shared with Josh and Andrea. The only exception is your list of dietary restrictions, which will be shared with the catering team.

# Attire

This will be a semi formal event. We're asking men to wear suits with ties. 

# Accommodation

May is a busy time of year in the Cambridge Masachusetts area. Booking early is important. If you plan to drive to Cambridge, please make a plan for parking your car when you arrange your accommodations. Parking in this area is scarce and parking enforcement can be harsh.

## Hotel Room Blocks

We've arranged courtesy room blocks at two local hotels. These rooms blocks will be available for booking until **April 24**.

| Hotel | Price | Booking Portal | Booking phone number | Distance from reception | 
| Marriot Kendall Square | $399 | [Booking website](https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1705508530715&key=GRP) | 800-228-9290 | [Across the street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fNaig7B3UQ6ftECcA) |
| Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill | $329 | [Booking website](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/wyndham/boston-massachusetts/wyndham-boston-beacon-hill/rooms-rates?brand_id=HR&checkInDate=5/24/2024&checkOutDate=5/26/2024&useWRPoints=false&children=0&groupCode=0524ANDJOS&adults=1&rooms=1&loc=ChIJGzE9DS1l44kRoOhiASS_fHg&sessionId=1706298730) | 877-999-3223 | [One mile](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NvWc8aowYgpmi4uz5) |

Notes:

- Both hotel room blocks are listed under the event name "Andrea Lehn & Josh Bradshaw Wedding".

- These room blocks are just courtesy holds for your convenience. Setting up these room blocks did not cost us any money, and we don't gain or lose any money based on your booking choices. Likewise, the pricing will not change based on the number of rooms booked.

- Any questions about the hotel amenities, hotel policies, or issues with the hotels should be directed to the hotels themselves.

## Alternative Accomodations

A general listing of hotels close to MIT [is available here](https://commencement.mit.edu/guests/visiting-cambridge/accommodations). One notable option is the Kendall Square hotel. This is a boutique hotel immediately beside our reception venue and directly across from the Marriott. We were unable to negotatiate any special rate with the Kendall Sq Hotel, but they would be one of our top choices if we were able to get a room there at a reasonable price.

For those looking to stay outside of the Kendall Square / MIT area, we suggest staying near the [MBTA Red Line](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf) [Porter Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4Fj5gcrcY5QdFHnz6), [Davis Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qLPQCDX8tfgtqZtZ9), or [Alewife stations](https://maps.app.goo.gl/H2DGYJ8CWRxAiugPA) for easy access via public transportation. These are good places to search for Airbnbs, larger hotel rooms and better deals.

Some of our extended family will be staying in their camper vans at a [campground at the edge of the city](https://spaciousskiescampgrounds.com/minute-man/) and riding in on the [commuter rail]( https://www.mbta.com/schedules/commuter-rail).

# Transportation

For out of town guests, our wedding venue is approximately three miles from the Logan Airport. Public transportation from Logan Airport to Cambridge is free. The taxi / Uber / Lyft ride is typically $30-35.

On the day of the wedding we suggest that guests arrive on foot, by [Boston Public Transit (MBTA)](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf), or by Taxi/Uber. The reception venue is located directly on top of the [Kendall Square MBTA stop](https://www.mbta.com/stops/place-knncl).

Driving to the wedding and reception is not recommended. The MIT police will set aside ten parking spaces at the Chapel for the duration of the ceremony, but there will not be any free parking available for the reception. MIT does have some (pretty expensive) [public parking options](https://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html). Hayward Garage is the closest visitor-friendly MIT parking lot to the reception venue. The most reasonably priced parking spaces in the area are the street parking spaces on Memorial Drive. Many restrictions apply to street parking, so read the (very confusing) signage carefully.

We especially advise against trying to park in the MIT Visitor Parking at the intersection of Massachusetts Ave and Vassar Street. For some reason this lot is the default that google will show you when you look for parking in the area despite this lot being much smaller than the Hayward Garage and just as expensive. Pulling into the cramped parking spaces in this lot is an advanced driving test, and a considerable fraction of parkers fail the test by bumping into their neighbors.

# Gifts

Joining us on our special day is the most important gift you could give us.

If you wish to give something extra, a little cash towards our future adventures would be wonderfully appreciated. Think of it as contributing to the "honeymoon and beyond" fund. For those who prefer a digital option, we setup a [paypal account](https://paypal.me/andreajoshwedding?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US).

# Notes for Out of Town Visitors

We will arrange a casual meet and greet for our out of town guests on the evening of Friday May 24.

## Places to Eat & Drink

In order of distance from the reception venue and the Marriott.

[Flat Top Johnny's](https://g.co/kgs/qrAD5ez) | Upscale pool hall on the same block as our reception venue. Across the street from the Marriott (hidden behind CVS). Pool table rentals cost about $20 / hour, prorated to the nearest minute. This place is spacious by Cambridge standards and makes for a nice meetup spot.
[Tatte](https://tattebakery.com/) | A bakery / cafe in our neighborhood. Not quite as good as flour in general, but the shakshuka is outstanding. The Shakshuka is a large hearty meal, so we often split it. Half a Shakshuka, a pastry and a coffee makes for an outstanding brunch at a sane price point.
[Miracle of Science](https://miracleofscience.us/) | MIT's defacto pub. The staff are friendly to large groups. A great option for a lunchtime meetup spot.
[Flour](https://www.flourbakery.com/) | The best bakery / cafe within walking distance. Close to the MIT chapel, so you can scope out the chapel location if you go here for breakfast or lunch.
[Blue Owl](https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-owl-cambridge) | A fun rooftop cocktail bar within walking distance of MIT. The views are excellent, but the food and service are just OK. We sometimes pop in here in the afternoon for one round of drinks when friends visit from out of town.
[Microcreamery](https://newcitymicrocreamery.com/newcitymicrocreamerycambridge) | The best ice cream place in our general area. Directly below Blue Owl.
[Oleana](https://www.oleanarestaurant.com/) | The best restaurant in our neighborhood.
[The Druid](https://www.druidpub.com/)            | Andrea & Josh's favorite pub. An Irish place serving outstanding fish & chips and shepherd's pie. The Druid is small and often fills up. Sometimes they host local acoustic musicians. Not the best option for a large group, unless you're going at a quieter time of day.

## Nearby Places to Visit

[Riverbend Park](https://www.cambridgema.gov/streetsandtransportation/memorialdrive#:~:text=The%20Massachusetts%20Legislature%20passes%20a,end%20of%20April%20until%20mid) | Memorial drive will be closed on the Sunday after our wedding. Walking down the river from MIT to Harvard Square is a beautiful way to spend the morning, with several cafe and snack options along the way.
[Boston Common](https://www.boston.gov/parks/boston-common) | Easily reachable by public transit. Also walking distance from Newbury Street.
[Newbury Street](https://www.boston-discovery-guide.com/newbury-street-shopping.html) | Boston's premiere shopping district. Home of [Trident bookseller's and cafe](https://www.tridentbookscafe.com/), which is Andrea and Josh's favourite brunch date spot. Sit by the windows on the second floor for optimal peoplewatching. 
[Harvard Natural History Museum](https://hmnh.harvard.edu/) | See the glass flowers.
[Harvard Arnold Arboretum](https://arboretum.harvard.edu/)       | One of Boston's premier parks.
[Boston Red Sox](https://www.mlb.com/redsox/tickets) | There will be a game on Sunday. Fenway park is just across the river.
