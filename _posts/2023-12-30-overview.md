# Date, Time & Location

Our wedding will take place on May 25th 2024. The ceremony will start at 5pm and the reception will start at 6pm. Dinner will be served.

Ceremony | MIT Chapel | [Website](https://studentlife.mit.edu/cac/event-services-spaces/event-spaces/mit-chapel) | [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xRdoz4kD7amgpMMJ8)
Reception | MIT Museum | [Website](https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/) | [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/asSMSx7WSqyuaUDC9)

We will be walking one and a half blocks from the ceremony to the reception as a group. There is an indoor route available in the event of rain. Please reach out if anyone in your party has mobility issues, so that we can arrange a shuttle.

# RSVP 

[RSVP Form](https://forms.gle/yNtpVW9MCpyCcn6j9). Responses are due April 25. The RSVP form is secure, and your personal information will only be shared with Josh and Andrea. The only exception is your list of dietary restrictions, which will be shared with the catering team.

# Attire

This will be a semi formal event. We're asking men to wear suits with dark ties. 

# Accommodation

May is a busy time of year in the Cambridge MA area, which means that accommodations are competitive. Booking early is important. If you plan to drive to Cambridge, please make a plan for parking your car when you arrange your accommodations. Parking in this area is scarce and parking enforcement can be harsh.

## Hotel Room Blocks

We've arranged courtesy room blocks at two local hotels. These rooms blocks will be available for booking until **April 24**.

| Hotel | Price | Booking Portal | Booking phone number | Distance from reception | 
| Marriot Kendall Square | $399 | [Booking website](https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1705508530715&key=GRP) | 800-228-9290 | [Across the street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fNaig7B3UQ6ftECcA) |
| Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill | $329 | [Booking website](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/wyndham/boston-massachusetts/wyndham-boston-beacon-hill/rooms-rates?brand_id=HR&checkInDate=5/24/2024&checkOutDate=5/26/2024&useWRPoints=false&children=0&groupCode=0524ANDJOS&adults=1&rooms=1&loc=ChIJGzE9DS1l44kRoOhiASS_fHg&sessionId=1706298730) | 877-999-3223 | [One mile](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NvWc8aowYgpmi4uz5) |

Notes:

- Both hotel room blocks are listed under the event name "Andrea Lehn & Josh Bradshaw Wedding". 

- These room blocks are just courtesy holds for your convenience. Setting up these room blocks did not cost us any money, and we don't gain or lose any money based on your booking choices.

## Alternative Accomodations

# Transportation

For out of town guests, our wedding venue is approximately three miles from the Logan Airport. Public transportation from Logan Airport to Cambridge is free. The taxi/Uber/Lyft ride is typically $30-35.

On the day of the wedding we suggest that guests arrive on foot, by [Boston Public Transit (MBTA)](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf), or by Taxi/Uber. The reception venue is located directly on top of the [Kendall Square MBTA stop](https://www.mbta.com/stops/place-knncl).

Driving to the wedding and reception is not recommended. The MIT police will set aside ten parking spaces at the Chapel for the duration of the ceremony. There will be no free parking available for the reception. MIT does have some expensive ($18+/hour) [public parking options](https://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html).
