## Overview 

Our wedding will take place on May 25th 2024 in the afternoon

* The ceremony will take place at MIT chapel [MIT Website](https://studentlife.mit.edu/cac/event-services-spaces/event-spaces/mit-chapel) [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xRdoz4kD7amgpMMJ8)
* The reception will take place at the MIT museum [MIT Museum](https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/) [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/asSMSx7WSqyuaUDC9)

## Transportation

We suggest that our guests arrive by Boston Public Transit (MBTA) [Subway Map](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf), or Taxi/Uber. The reception venue is directly on top of the Kendall Square red line subway station. 

The chapel and the reception are separated by a beautiful 15 minute walk along the Charles river [Google maps directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/MIT+Chapel,+48+Massachusetts+Ave,+Cambridge,+MA+02139,+United+States/MIT+Museum,+Gambrill+Center,+314+Main+St,+Cambridge,+MA+02142,+United+States/@42.3611752,-71.11131,14z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37a0081ab0b7d:0xfd6b535be007b424!2m2!1d-71.0941349!2d42.3583155!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e37754d18b40ef:0xcba82b413cc2736d!2m2!1d-71.0863641!2d42.362114!3e2?entry=ttu). In the event of rain our guests can walk through MIT, because these two locations are connected by a series of hallways. 

We have reserved ten parking spaces at the Chapel for the duration of the ceremony. For the reception, street parking may be available on Memorial drive (least expensive option). Failing that, MIT does have some [public parking options](https://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/visitors/public_parking.html). Garage parking in the area costs ~$15-18 / hour, and has very limited availability. Driving to our wedding is strongly discouraged. 

## Accommodation  

The majority of the guests at our wedding live within walking distance of the venue. For our younger guests we may be able to setup house-sharing arrangements. Staying in Cambridge MA in May is extremely expensive. May is a busy time of year in the Boston area which means it is essential to make hotel reservations early. A listing of hotels close to MIT is available here: [https://commencement.mit.edu/guests/visiting-cambridge/accommodations](https://commencement.mit.edu/guests/visiting-cambridge/accommodations). We fully understand if the cost of accommodation prohibits your attendance.

Less expensive accommodations can be found in Cambridge and Somerville. We suggest staying near the [MBTA red line](https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022-12-12-subway-map-v37f.pdf) Davis Square Porter or Alewife stations for more affordable accommodations which are still reasonably accessible. 

## Gifts

We will be moving twice in 2024 and we are blessed to have more than enough belongings. We will only be accepting cash-based gifts.
